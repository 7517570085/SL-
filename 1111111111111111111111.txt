💎 ACID Properties in DBMS

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
These four properties ensure that database transactions are processed reliably — even in cases of errors, power failures, or crashes.

🧩 1. Atomicity (All or Nothing)

A transaction is an indivisible unit of work.

Either all the operations of a transaction are completed successfully, or none are applied.

If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to the previous consistent state.

Example:
Transferring ₹1000 from Account A to Account B:

Deduct ₹1000 from A

Add ₹1000 to B

If step 2 fails (e.g., power failure), step 1 is rolled back so no money is lost.

Mechanism used:
➡️ Commit (confirm) or Rollback (undo).

⚖️ 2. Consistency

Ensures that the database remains valid before and after a transaction.

Any transaction should transform the database from one consistent state to another.

All constraints, triggers, and rules must be satisfied after a transaction.

Example:
If a table has a constraint balance >= 0,
a transaction should never result in a negative balance.

If it tries to do so, the transaction fails and is rolled back to maintain consistency.

🔒 3. Isolation

Ensures that concurrent transactions (executing at the same time) do not interfere with each other.

Each transaction should behave as if it’s the only one running in the system.

Example:
If two users try to update the same account at the same time,
one transaction’s intermediate changes should not be visible to the other until it is committed.

Levels of Isolation:

Read Uncommitted – Can see uncommitted changes (dirty reads).

Read Committed – Can only see committed data.

Repeatable Read – Ensures same data is read multiple times.

Serializable – Highest isolation, transactions execute one after another.

💾 4. Durability

Once a transaction is committed, its results are permanent, even if the system fails.

Data is saved to non-volatile memory (disk) after commit.

Ensures data survives crashes, power loss, or system errors.

Example:
If money transfer succeeds and system crashes right after,
the transaction remains recorded when the system restarts.

Mechanism used:
➡️ Transaction logs, backups, and checkpoints.

1. What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to store, manipulate, and retrieve data from relational databases.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔑 4. Primary Key

A column (or set) that uniquely identifies each row.
➡️ No NULL, no duplicate.

🌐 5. Foreign Key

A column that refers to the primary key of another table to link them.

🧭 6. UNIQUE Key

Ensures all values in a column are unique (can have one NULL).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Normalization

Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
Types:
1NF → Atomic values
2NF → No partial dependency
3NF → No transitive dependency
BCNF → Stronger form of 3NF
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Join Operations

Used to combine rows from multiple tables based on related columns.

INNER JOIN → Matching rows only

LEFT JOIN → All from left + matching from right

RIGHT JOIN → All from right + matching from left

FULL JOIN → All rows from both tables

CROSS JOIN → Cartesian product
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Index

Used to speed up data retrieval.

Types:

Clustered Index → Data stored in order of index (only one per table).

Non-Clustered Index → Separate structure from data (can have many).

Unique Index → Prevents duplicate values.

Composite Index → On multiple columns.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is a Trigger?

A trigger is a stored program in a database that automatically executes (fires) when a specific event occurs on a table.

Events:

INSERT

UPDATE

DELETE

Used for:

Maintaining audit logs

Enforcing business rules

Automatic calculations

Preventing invalid operations

Example:
A trigger that automatically updates the last_modified column whenever a row is updated.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🪟 What is a View?

A view is a virtual table created from a SQL query.
It does not store data physically; it only displays data from one or more tables.

Used for:

Simplifying complex queries

Providing security (hide specific columns)

Presenting customized data to users
